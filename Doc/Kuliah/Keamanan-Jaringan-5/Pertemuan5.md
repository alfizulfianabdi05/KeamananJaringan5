Spoofing is a "technique used to gain unauthorized access to a computer or information, which an attacker associated with the user by pretending to falsify that they are hosts to be believed" this is usually done by a hacker / cracker.
 
Macam-Macam Spoofing
- IP-Spoofing is a complex technical attack yant consists of several components. It is a security exploit that works by tricking computers in a trust relationship that you are someone else. There are many papers written by daemon9, route, and infinity in the Volume Seven, Issue fourty-Eight Phrack magazine.
- DNS spoofing is taking the DNS name of another system with a domain name server jeopardize a legitimate domain.
- Identify Spoofing is an act of intrusion by using official identity illegally. By using this identity, the intruder will be able to access anything on the network.
 
As I know now tebagi 2 Spoofing techniques, including:

1. Arp Poisoning As described in the previous article, using arp poisoning we can characterize a fake mac address so that the victim node to node casualties resulting manipulated router can not be accessed. This is usually done if you want to transfer data or want to access to the internet.

2. With dns spoofing DNS spoofing, we can give the victim node be IP or domain that is not an actual domain. This is actually really should be alert because when we become a crime victim DNS spoofing, the data that we receive or we enter into the IP or domain is not real data (in our context receive data), while those that use DNS Spoofing will use data we have put to use. Real examples of DNS Spoofing is when we enter data such as username and password, the data will be sent to the node offenders, so that the perpetrators can use the username and password of victims and steal data or use the victim's account that the majority resulted in losses.
How to overcome this by ensuring that our arp table can not be updated and we have to be more observant, when there is a slight error on network problems, very disarakankan to check Arp Table (if on Windows Operating System, can use the command arp -a).
